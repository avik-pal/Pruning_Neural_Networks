# Pruning Challenge

## Problem Description

We have a simple 3 hidden layered neural network. All the layers are a simple linear layer without any bias, i.e., a simple matmul and followed by relu activation.

```python
out = tf.maximum(tf.matmul(x, W), 0.0)
```

The entire neural network can be simply described as:

```python
out1 = tf.maximum(tf.matmul(inp, W1), 0.0)
out2 = tf.maximum(tf.matmul(out1, W2), 0.0)
out3 = tf.maximum(tf.matmul(out2, W3), 0.0)
out4 = tf.maximum(tf.matmul(out3, W4), 0.0)
out5 = tf.maximum(tf.matmul(out4, W5), 0.0)
```

Now we have 2 pruning strategies -
1. Weight Pruning
2. Neuron/Unit Pruning

We need to compare the two strategies based on the accuracy attained while training the model on MNIST.

## Steps to Reproduce Results

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m virtualenv pruning
# Activate the environment
source pruning/bin/activate
# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The pruning step is expensive and the models are trained for `100` epochs, so it is recommended to carry out the training in a GPU/TPU environment.

```bash
# Train the models
python main.py
# To get the plots
python plotting.py
```

Don't alter the directories generated by `main.py`, `plotting.py` needs them in the exact order.

**NOTE**: We train 2 models at a time. So it is recommended to have sufficient GPU memory.

You can use `train.py` to train individual models. For the instructions use `python train.py --help`. This will list the arguments it needs.

If you want to train 1 model at a time use the `main_alternate.py` script.
